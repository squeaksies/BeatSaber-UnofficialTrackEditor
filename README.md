## This project is very functional, but the features are.

Currently supports:

+ Loading a WAV or MP3 file into the editor. (No OGG yet!)

+ Loading / Saving track .json files
 
+ Placing / deleting notes, mines, events, and obstacles

+ Locking the grid to 8th / 16th / 32nd notes, or placing at arbitrary positions

+ Placing notes while the track is playing by pressing keys on the keyboard.

To run:

## Grab the latest binary from the Releases tab

If you are using the Mac OS app, you will need to manually allow it in gatekeeper since it's unsigned. 

Here is a screenshot with more information:
